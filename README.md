Over the course of the summer of 2025, I spent time creating this 2D adventure game, "Treasure Hunter" from scratch,
in Java. Through the helpful tutorials of RyiSnow on YouTube and experience of working with Java at my University,
I created my first game with a storyline, player inventory and attack capabilities, map switching, merchant trading,
and an ultimate goal to find the sacred treasure! NPC dialogue and a visually appealing UI help the player navigate
through the island and dungeon maps, meeting friends and foes along the way. The experience of coding this game taught
me many aspects of game development as a whole, including the use of a tile editor, pixel art, and music production.
With all being said, good luck, have fun, and go find that treasure!
